#  HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists
## Introduction

A company specializing in Big Data and Data Science runs training programs to prepare potential candidates for data-related roles. While many individuals participate, not all intend to work for the company after training.

The dataset includes:
- Demographic information
- Education and major discipline
- Work experience
- Training enrollment and job change status
