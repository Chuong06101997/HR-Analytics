#  HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists
## Introduction
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fba35d28-afd0-4314-9270-7d7ad3105853)


A company specializing in Big Data and Data Science runs training programs to prepare potential candidates for data-related roles. While many individuals participate, not all intend to work for the company after training.

This project helps the company identify which candidates are likely to stay or leave. The goal is to support better hiring, reduce training costs, and optimize the course design.
The dataset includes:
- Demographic information
- Education and major discipline
- Work experience
- Training enrollment and job change status

## Data Description
### 1. Enrollies' data
As enrollies are submitting their request to join the course via Google Forms, we have the Google Sheet that stores data about enrolled students, containing the following columns:

`enrollee_id`: unique ID of an enrollee

`full_name`: full name of an enrollee

`city`: the name of an enrollie's city

`gender`: gender of an enrollee

Source : <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCkHwBjJGRJ21asd9pxW4_0z2PWuKhbLR3gUHm-p4GI/edit?usp=sharing>

### 2.  Enrollies' education

After enrollment everyone should fill the form about their education level. This form is being digitalized manually. Educational department stores it in the Excel format here: <https://assets.swisscoding.edu.vn/company_course/enrollies_education.xlsx>

This table contains the following columns:

`enrollee_id`: A unique identifier for each enrollee. This integer value uniquely distinguishes each participant in the dataset.

`enrolled_university`: Indicates the enrollee's university enrollment status. Possible values include no_enrollment, Part time course, and Full time course.

`education_level`: Represents the highest level of education attained by the enrollee. Examples include Graduate, Masters, etc.

`major_discipline`: Specifies the primary field of study for the enrollee. Examples include STEM, Business Degree, etc.
### 3. Enrollies' working experience
Another survey that is being collected manually by educational department is about working experience.

Educational department stores it in the CSV format here: <https://assets.swisscoding.edu.vn/company_course/work_experience.csv>

This table contains the following columns:

`enrollee_id`: A unique identifier for each enrollee. This integer value uniquely distinguishes each participant in the dataset.

`relevent_experience`: Indicates whether the enrollee has relevant work experience related to the field they are currently studying or working in. Possible values include Has relevent experience and No relevent experience.

`experience`: Represents the number of years of work experience the enrollee has. This can be a specific number or a range (e.g., >20, <1).

`company_size`: Specifies the size of the company where the enrollee has worked, based on the number of employees. Examples include 50−99, 100−500, etc.

`company_type`: Indicates the type of company where the enrollee has worked. Examples include Pvt Ltd, Funded Startup, etc.

`last_new_job`: Represents the number of years since the enrollee's last job change. Examples include never, >4, 1, etc.

### 4. Training hours

From LMS system's database you can retrieve a number of training hours for each student that they have completed.

Database credentials:

```Database type: MySQL```

```Host: 112.213.86.31```

```Port: 3360```

```Login: etl_practice```

```Password: 550814```

```Database name: company_course```

```Table name: training_hours```

### 5. City development index
Another source that can be usefull is the table of City development index.

The City Development Index (CDI) is a measure designed to capture the level of development in cities. It may be significant for the resulting prediction of student's employment motivation.

It is stored here: https://sca-programming-school.github.io/city_development_index/index.html

### 6. Employment
From LMS database you can also retrieve the fact of employment. If student is marked as employed, it means that this student started to work in our company after finishing the course.

Database credentials:

`Database type: MySQL`

`Host: 112.213.86.31`

`Port: 3360`

`Login: etl_practice`

`Password: 550814`

`Database name: company_course`

`Table name: employment`

### 3.Load Data
3.1 Manually Inserting DataFrames into SQLite
```
db_path = 'data_warehouse.db'
engine = create_engine(f'sqlite:///{db_path}')
enrollies_data.to_sql('dim_enrollies_data', engine, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)
enrollies_education.to_sql('fact_enrollies_education', engine, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)
work_experience.to_sql('dim_work_experience', engine, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)
cities.to_sql('dim_cities', engine, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)
employment.to_sql('dim_enrollies', engine, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)
```
3.2 Refactoring DataFrame to SQL Insertion with SQLAlchemy
```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
```
```
def save_to_sql(tables, db_path='data_warehouse.db'):
    engine = create_engine(f'sqlite:///{db_path}')
    for df, table_name in tables:
        df.to_sql(table_name, engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)

tables_to_save = [
    (enrollies_data, 'dim_enrollies_data'),
    (enrollies_education, 'dim_enrollies_education'),
    (work_experience, 'dim_work_experience'),
    (cities, 'dim_cities'),
    (employment, 'fact_enrollies')
]

save_to_sql(tables_to_save)
```
