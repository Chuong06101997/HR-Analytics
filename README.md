#  HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists
## Introduction

A company specializing in Big Data and Data Science runs training programs to prepare potential candidates for data-related roles. While many individuals participate, not all intend to work for the company after training.

This project helps the company identify which candidates are likely to stay or leave. The goal is to support better hiring, reduce training costs, and optimize the course design.
The dataset includes:
- Demographic information
- Education and major discipline
- Work experience
- Training enrollment and job change status

## Data Description
1. Enrollies' data
As enrollies are submitting their request to join the course via Google Forms, we have the Google Sheet that stores data about enrolled students, containing the following columns:

`enrollee_id`: unique ID of an enrollee

`full_name`: full name of an enrollee

`city`: the name of an enrollie's city

`gender`: gender of an enrollee
